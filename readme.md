## What does it do?
Each (resurrectable) enemy that spawns has about a 1 in 3 chance of being *Cursed*. You won't be able to see which enemies are Cursed--at least, not initially.

The fun starts when you kill a Cursed enemy. At semi-random intervals, Cursed enemies will *come back to life*. There are two ways to prevent this:

1. Gib the enemy. Enemies that enter their XDeath state will lose their Cursed status, bringing a permanent end to their torment. The *Holy Symbol* will instantly gib cursed enemies in a small radius when you use it, but you'll have to get up real close, and Holy Symbols can be hard to find...
2. Kill all Cursed enemies before the curse kicks in. When the curse activates, if *EVERY* Cursed enemy is currently dead, they won't rez. This is hard to do on larger maps. Also, if a newly-spawned enemy is Cursed, their formerly-Cursed friends will be able to get back up again!

## Why?
So I was playing with [Legion](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=76032), and I found myself really enjoying the way Undead in that monsterpack tend to get back up if you don't deal with the bodies. I liked that mechanic *so* much, that I wanted to make it universal, so I could use it with monsters that aren't *quite* so tanky. 

I also wanted it to be somewhat random, so that I have to *guess* which enemies are going to get back up--if *EVERY* enemy gets back up after I kill it, that takes all of the tension out of it, and now I just have to find the most efficient way to gib everything (probably with a door). If only about 1/3rd of the things I fight actually need to be gibbed, then I have a good reason to *avoid* gibbing every enemy, since it'll be a waste of ammo about 2/3rds of the time. (I think this'll play especially well with [War Rooster](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=75855), since that mod also adds hallucinations--is that Revenant fireball just a figment of your imagination, or did one of the skully boys end up cursed?)

I recommend playing this with [Universal Gibs](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=46&t=59260), and turning on corpse damage, so that once you've ID'd a cursed enemy you can actually *deal* with it in mapsets
